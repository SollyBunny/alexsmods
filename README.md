# Alex's Mods
A mod pack to play w/ my friends

Version: 1.20.1 forge

The main download is a MultiMC / PrismMC / PolyMC instance: Press *extract from zip* / *import* when creating an instance and select (or *browse* for) the zip you have downloaded

You can also download the config and mods seperately, although they use an external (web) tool to do so
